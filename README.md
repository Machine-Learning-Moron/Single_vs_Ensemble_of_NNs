# Single_vs_Ensemble_of_NNs

Training ensembles of deep learning models to understand their advantages in terms of performance.  
Looking for more efficient distribution of training/computational budgets.  

In this [separated repository][1] can be found Dashboards to explore the results obtained. 
Some of them already deployed **requires username and password**:

- [ResNets Ensemble][2]
- [VGGs Ensemble][3]
